- 👋 Hi, I’m @LINSANITY03 aka Pujan Thing.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating software having real world impact and knowing how things work.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on building AI agents with [robsca](https://github.com/robsca) on [Duck-Soup](https://github.com/duck-soup).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects with interest in Finance, AI/ML as well as blockchains.
- One of my new todo is to learn Go, as I want to know more about network servers 😋.
- 📫 How to reach me pujantamang92@gmail.com
